# Bender's decomposition interpreted as iterative multi-item auction

Python version 2.7

Iterative implementation of DW (based on Fadaei's approach, 2015) and Bender's decomposition (within Lavi & Swamy Framework for truthful mechanisms).
Not generalized for any packing problem, only multi-unit auctions.

Basically also implements revised simplex (numerically naive!) for multi-unit auctions. Could be generalized easily.
